        <p>
          The SIMS Health Index is a powerful asset health monitoring tool that
          delivers clear, actionable insights into the condition of structural
          assets across your operation. By leveraging your existing operational
          data, it enables instant tracking, visualization, and analysis of
          asset condition, risk exposure, and maintenance costs all in one
          intuitive dashboard.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Developed in alignment with Anglo American’s
          <em>SIMM Guidelines for Plant Structures and Conveyances</em>, the
          SIMS Health Index brings a strategic management lens to structural
          integrity. It empowers decision-makers to balance risk, cost, and
          performance with confidence.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You already have the data. You already have the team. SIMS Health
          Index provides clarity, clarity that drives decisions, not just
          reports. It is more than dashboard, it’s a strategic decision support
          tool that enhances planning, improves outcomes, and strengthens
          performance. It doesn’t replace your current processes, it amplifies
          them. It’s familiar, easy to use, and designed to work with the
          systems and data you already rely on.

        <h2>Condition</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          The fundamental purpose of plant structure and conveyance condition
          inspections is to confirm that the plant remains safe for productive
          use. Condition categories follow Anglo American’s SIMM Guidelines,
          while the extent rating indicates how common a particular defect is on
          the inspected item or area.

        <p>
          Remedial action priority levels and defect criticality levels are key
          elements in managing infrastructure asset risk. They support the
          assessment of defect severity and the urgency of response, based on
          potential impacts on safety, operations, and compliance. Priority
          levels are informed by an extension of Anglo American’s SIMM
          Guidelines and criticality levels are composed of factors such as
          safety implications, repair costs, and potential production losses
          associated with asset failure, where a level A has a higher threshold
          (more critcal) and a level D a lower threshold (less critical).

                typically applied to high-priority production conveyors and

        <p>
          SIMM audits generate detailed remedial action lists that serve as
          critical inputs into a mine’s structural maintenance and
          rehabilitation programme. These programmes typically include
          initiatives such as steel rehabilitation, corrosion protection, and
          concrete restoration, each comprising multiple projects with varying
          scopes and priorities.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The cost requirements for these projects are often significant and
          frequently exceed the available maintenance budget. As a result,
          prioritisation becomes essential. The SIMS Health Index plays a key
          role in this process by tracking actual investments made in structural
          maintenance and quantifying their impact on asset condition and risk
          exposure.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The ultimate objective is to invest strategically, allocating enough
          resources to reduce and stabilise structural risk below defined
          thresholds or KPIs, while observing the convergence of overall
          structural condition toward a manageable and sustainable state. This
          approach ensures that limited budgets are directed where they deliver
          the greatest operational and safety value.
